   <abstract>
     <t>Multiple software vendors have developed products to address limitations of TCP over different network technologies.  These products attempt to address issues with delayed ACKs, limited bandwidth and poor protocol design.  They typically use IP or TCP Options for the detection of their products in the flow of IP packets without proper IANA assignment and authorization.</t>
     <t>Network Optimizer Detection (NOD) facilitates an open, standardized method for these vendors to detect their product using a single IANA assigned IP or TCP Option while maintaining the vendors ability to append proprietary extensions to the NOD Option for their product functionality.</t>
   </abstract>

   <section title="Introduction">
     <t>Network Optimization Appliances also know as Performance Enhancing Proxies typically contain some method of auto-detection to determine if a flow of IP packets is eligible for optimization.  To accomplish this multiple vendors have chosen to append non-standardized Options to IP packets or TCP segments that are routed through their product.  The Option number used varies from vendor to vendor.  Eventually when the Option number being used without authorization is assigned by IANA the vendor will have to update their code to prevent conflict with the official IANA assigned use.</t>
	 <t>Network Optimizer Detection (NOD) allows multiple vendors to use a single IANA assigned IP Option or TCP Option number to uniquely identify and detect their appliances without using unauthorized IP Option or TCP Option numbers.</t>

     <section title="Requirements Language">
       <t>The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
       "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
       document are to be interpreted as described in <xref

   <section anchor="format" title="Network Optimization Detection IP and TCP Option Format">
     <t>This variable length option can be present in SYN and non-SYN packets. The vendors optimization logic determines if the option is only in SYN packet or is also in non-SYN packet.  The NOD Option functions as a transport mechanism for the vendor specific data structures.</t>

	 <t>The Network Optimization Detection option is used to convey information about the presence of a network optimizer to another optimizer at the far end of a network connection.</t>
     <t>The first required field in the NOD option is the total length of the option.  This is variable as it will be adjusted when vedors add their proprietary fields.</t>
	 <t>The second required field in the NOD option is the length in bytes used for vendor identification.  Some vendors may desire using 1-4 bytes to identify their product.</t>
     <t>The third required field in the NOD option is ID Data.  This contains the actually identifying data for the vendor.</t> 
	 
   </section>

   <section title="Embedding proprietary data">
     <t>Because the NOD option length is variable a vendor can embed additional data within the NOD option.  This eliminates the need to use additional unauthorized Options for sending vendor specific data.  The structure and data types appended to the NOD option is irrelevant to the specification here only that the total length field be appended appropriately to support the additional data in the NOD option.  The NOD option acts as a transport mechanism for the optimization software.</t>

   <!-- References split into informative and normative -->

   <!-- There are 2 ways to insert reference entries from the citation libraries:
    1. define an ENTITY at the top, and use "ampersand character"RFC2629; here (as shown)
    2. simply use a PI "less than character"?rfc include="reference.RFC.2119.xml"?> here
       (for I-Ds: include="reference.I-D.narten-iana-considerations-rfc2434bis.xml")

    Both are cited textually in the same manner: by using xref elements.
    If you use the PI option, xml2rfc will, by default, try to find included files in the same
    directory as the including file. You can also define the XML_LIBRARY environment variable
    with a value containing a set of directories to search.  These can be either in the local
    filing system or remote ones accessed by http (http://domain/dir/... ).-->
